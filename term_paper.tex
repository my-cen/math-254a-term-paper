\section{Introduction}
The 15-theorem states that a positive-definite quadratic form $Q$ having integer matrix represents all positive integers if and only if it represents the nine numbers $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15$. A strengthening of it states that a positive-definite integer-matrix quadratic form represents all positive integers besides $15$ if and only if it represents all integers below $15$.

In 1993, Conway and Schneeberger announced the first proof of the $15$-theorem. They did not publish it, because it required several complex arguments for many cases. In 2000, Bhargava \cite{fifteen} found a simple proof using escalations of quadratic forms, which we will present in this paper.

\section{Definitions}
The word ``integer-matrix'' means the same as the notion of being classically integral. There is a well-known natural bijection between lattices with integer inner products and positive-definite integer-matrix quadratic forms. For convenience, a lattice or quadratic form refers to a positive-definite integer-matrix lattice or quadratic form. A quadratic form or its corresponding lattice is called universal if it represents all positive integers. If it is not universal, its truant is the smallest positive integer not represented. An escalation of a lattice $L$ is the lattice generated by $L$ and a vector of norm equal to the truant of $L$. An escalator lattice is one reached from a series of escalations from the zero lattice. A quadratic form has integer matrix if its matrix has only integer entries, and it is integer valued if when expressed as a polynomial, all coefficients are integers.

\section{Proof of $15$-theorem}
\subsection{Escalators of dimension $\le 3$}
The only quadratic form in $0$ variables is $0$, with truant $1$. Its unique escalation is $x^2$ (equivalently $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \end{bmatrix}$ as a matrix) with truant $2$, hence further escalations of dimension $2$ must have Gram matrix of the form
\[\begin{bmatrix} 1 & a \\ a & 2 \end{bmatrix}.\]
By Cauchy-Schwarz, $a$ is $0$ or $\pm 1$, creating two nonisomorphic escalations with Minkowski-reduced Gram matrices
\[\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}.\]
Their truants are $3$ and $5$, respectively. By a similar argument, we can compute the $9$ three-dimensional escalations: they have Minkowski-reduced Gram matrices
\[\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 4 \end{bmatrix},\]
\[\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 5 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 \end{bmatrix}.\]
By computation, they have truants $7, 14, 6, 7, 10, 7, 14, 7, 10$. Escalating again gives $207$ nonisomorphic four-dimensional escalator lattices; we will prove $201$ are universal and the other $6$ can be escalated again.

\subsection{Escalators of dimension $4$ and $5$}
For most of the four-dimensional escalators $L$, we can prove that they are universal easily. We find a $3$-dimensional sublattice $L'$ that is unique in its genus and use local arguments to prove that $L'$ represents all but a certain set of numbers, using an argument similar to the proof of the three-square theorem. For example, if $L'$ has Gram matrix $\begin{bsmallmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bsmallmatrix}$, then $L'$ represents numbers that are not of the form $4^a b$, where $a \ge 0$ and $b \equiv 7 \pmod 8$. Let $m$ be the single entry in the Gram matrix of the orthogonal complement of $L'$ in $L$. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $L$ is not universal, and let $u$ be its truant. We can determine that $u$ is squarefree. By considering $u - xm$ where $x$ depends on $m$ modulo a certain number, we can find an upper bound for $u$. By manually checking $L$ represents all natural numbers below the upper bound, this shows $u$ cannot exist, so $L$ is universal.

As an example, let $L$ be an escalation of $L' = \begin{bsmallmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 2 \end{bsmallmatrix}$, where the orthogonal complement of $L'$ in $L$ has Gram matrix with one entry $m$. Since $L'$ is unique in its genus, we may calculate the numbers represented by it using calculations over the completions of $\mathbb{Q}$. Hence, it represents everything but positive integers of the form $4^a (8b + 7)$, where $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative integers.

Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $L$ is not universal, and let its truant be $u$. Since $L'$ cannot represent $u$, we can write $u$ in the form $4^a (8b + 7)$. Since $u$ is minimal, it is squarefree, so $a = 0$ and $u \equiv 7 \pmod 8$. We consider three cases depending on $m$ modulo $8$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $m$ is not congruent to $0$, $3$, or $7$ modulo $8$, then $u-m$ cannot be of the form $4^a (8b + 7)$.
    \item If $m \equiv 3, 7 \pmod 8$, then $u-4m$ cannot be of the form $4^a (8b + 7)$ either.
    \item If $m \equiv 0 \pmod 8$, then $L$ is called exceptional, and we have to use a different $L'$. More details are provided later in this paper.
\end{itemize}

Therefore, either $u < 4m$ or $u - m$ or $u - 4m$ (depending on $m \pmod 8$) is represented by $L'$. Because $L = L' \oplus [m]$, if $u - m$ or $u - 4m$ is represented by $L'$, $u$ is represented by $L$. This is false by assumption. Hence, $u$ must be less than $4m$. By computation, $m \le 28$, so $u < 112 = 4 \cdot 28$. Now that we have bounded $u$, we use computer checks to show that $L$ represents all positive integers up to $112$. This shows $u$ did not exist in the first place, so $L$ is universal.

By a similar argument, we find $201$ out of $207$ quaternary lattices are universal. There are only a couple of cases where different arguments have to be used. The three-dimensional escalator lattice
\[L = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 4 \end{bmatrix}\]
is the only one not unique in its genus, but it is ``nearly'' unique in its genus. Namely, it contains the lattice
\[\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 4 & 2 \\ 0 & 2 & 8 \end{bmatrix},\]
which is unique in its genus, and it contains the two lattices
\[\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -2 & 2 \\ -2 & 5 & 2 \\ 2 & 2 & 8 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 5 & 4 \\ 0 & 4 & 5 \end{bmatrix}\]
that together form a genus. The former genus represents all numbers locally represented by $L$ that are not congruent to $2, 3 \pmod 4$, and the latter genus is the same except the condition is replaced with being congruent to $1 \pmod 3$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, this makes $L$ represent all numbers it locally represents that are not $7$ or $10 \pmod{12}$. This condition is nearly as good as being unique in a genus, so we may apply essentially the same argument as before.

Exceptional four-dimensional lattices $L$ can usually still have the argument above apply by changing $L'$. There are only five cases when there are no $L'$ that make $L$ non-exceptional. In those cases, we find a unique-in-its-genus three-dimensional sublattice $L'$ and apply mostly the same argument.

The other $6$ four-dimensional lattices are
\[\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 4 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 5 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 5 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & 2 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 & 8 \end{bmatrix},\]
and
\[\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 9 \end{bmatrix}.\]
These are not universal, with truants either $10$ or $15$. We may apply the same argument as above, but the final check that $L$ represents all positive integers up to some number fails with just one number. This shows that these $6$ lattices each miss that number and no others. That number is the lattice's truant, so the $5$-dimensional escalators of the lattice must be universal. This allows us to skip verifying every single one of the $1630$ five-dimensional escalators of these quadratic forms is universal.

This shows all escalators of the zero lattice are at most $5$-dimensional, and that there are exactly $1850$ nonisomorphic escalator lattices of the zero lattice: $1$ of dimension $0$, $1$ of dimension $1$, $2$ of dimension $2$, $9$ of dimension $3$, $207$ of dimension $4$, and $1630$ of dimension $5$. The non-universal escalators of $0$ we found have truants $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14$ and $15$. This proves the $15$-theorem, and that each of these numbers is actually necessary. Since each of the four escalators of the zero lattice that has truant $15$ is four-dimensional and hence must represent all other positive integers, the strengthening of the $15$-theorem is proved. Furthermore, $15$ is special: there exist quadratic forms that miss infinitely many integers starting from any of the critical integers beside $15$.

The $15$-theorem has several corollaries. This also proves that a universal lattice $L$ must contain a universal sublattice of dimension $5$ or less, because $L$ must contain a chain of escalations of the zero lattice. In addition, this provides an easy classification of universal $4$-variable positive-definite integer-matrix quadratic forms: we can find a bound on the discriminant and systematically apply the $15$-theorem to find there are exactly $204$ of them. This was used by Bhargava to determine that Willerding's classification of universal quaternary forms had errors.

\section{Generalizations}

\end{table}

The $290$-theorem states that an integer-\emph{valued} positive-definite quadratic form is universal if and only if it represents all numbers less than $290$, and it has a similar strengthening as the $15$-theorem. The structure of the proof is mostly the same: the small-dimensional escalators of the zero lattice are examined and shown to have truant less than $290$, and the larger-dimensional escalators are proven to be universal. However, it requires analytic techniques involving many calculations because some universal integer-valued $4$-dimensional lattices do not have $3$-dimensional sublattices unique in their genera, and more advanced arithmetic techniques are inefficient at proving the universality of thousands of quadratic forms. The $33$- and $451$-theorem prove similar statements for odd universal integer-valued and integer-matrix quadratic forms, respectively. There have been various generalizations to quadratic forms representing prime numbers (insert reference here), numbers coprime to a certain prime (insert reference here), and more.
