\section{Introduction}
Lagrange's famous four-square theorem states that the quadratic form $x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2$ represents all natural numbers. One may wonder which other quadratic forms have this property of representing all natural numbers. For example, $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2w^2$ works as well. A solution is provided by the 15-Theorem, which I will discuss in this talk.

First, we need to specify which quadratic forms we are looking at. For a quadratic form, ``integer-matrix'' means that when the quadratic form is represented as a symmetric matrix, all entries are integers. ``Integer-valued'' is a more lenient condition that allows off-diagonal entries to be half-integers.

The 15-Theorem states that a positive-definite integer-matrix quadratic form (which I will refer to as simply a quadratic form from now on) represents all positive integers exactly when it represents 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, and 15. These nine numbers are called critical numbers.

I have created SageMath code for some computations required for the 15-theorem.

\section{Definitions}
There is a well-known natural bijection between lattices with integer inner products and positive-definite integer-matrix quadratic forms, so any operation on a lattice can be applied to a quadratic form, and vice versa. I am going to use lattices and quadratic forms in the proof, whichever is most convenient.

A quadratic form or its corresponding lattice is defined to be \emph{universal} if it represents all positive integers. For example, $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2+3e^2$ is universal by the four-square theorem. If a quadratic form $Q$ is not universal, its \emph{truant} is defined to be the smallest positive integer not represented. An \emph{escalation} of a lattice $L$ is a lattice generated by $L$ and a vector of norm equal to the truant of $L$. An \emph{escalator lattice} is one reached from a series of escalations from the zero lattice. We will consider escalator lattices only, because they contain the necessary information for all quadratic forms.

\section{Proof of the 15-Theorem}
\subsection{Escalators of dimension 1, 2, and 3}
It is very easy to determine the escalators of dimension up to 4. When we try to escalate again, we find that some of the 207 four-dimensional escalators are universal. An important issue is to determine which ones are universal.

\subsection{Escalators of dimension 4}
We want to show 201 of the 207 quaternary escalators are universal, and the other 6 have truants 10 or 15.

As an illustrative example for the argument for the 201 universal quaternaries, let $L$ be an escalation of $L' = \begin{bsmallmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 2 \end{bsmallmatrix}$, where the orthogonal complement of $L'$ in $L$ has Gram matrix with one entry $m$. Since $L'$ is unique in its genus, we may apply the Hasse-Minkowski principle to go from the global setting of the integers to the local setting of the $p$-adic numbers. Through some application of Hensel's lemma, we find that $L'$ represents everything but positive integers of the form $4^a (8b + 7)$, where $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative integers.

Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $L$ is not universal, and let its truant be $u$. Through some argument, we find that $u$ is $7$ modulo $8$.

Using arguments on $m \pmod 8$, we obtain three possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $u < 4m$
    \item $u - m$ represented by $L'$
    \item $u - 4m$ represented by $L'$
\end{itemize}
Because $L = L' \oplus [m]$, if $u - m$ or $u - 4m$ is represented by $L'$, $u$ is represented by $L$. This is false by assumption. Hence, $u$ must be less than $4m$. By computation, $m \le 28$, so $u < 112 = 4 \cdot 28$. Now that we have bounded $u$, we use computer checks to show that $L$ represents all positive integers up to $112$. This shows $u$ did not exist in the first place, so $L$ is universal.

There are a few special cases where a slightly modified argument must be applied, but in the end, 201 quaternary escalators are shown to be universal. By applying similar arguments for the non-universal quaternary escalators, all five-dimensional escalators are universal. By analyzing all escalators, we prove the 15-Theorem.

By application of the 15-Theorem, we easily obtain an extremely useful classification of universal four-dimensional quadratic forms, namely, that there are exactly $204$ non-isomorphic universal four-dimensional quadratic forms.

\section{Related results}
The 290-Theorem states the same thing as the 15-Theorem, except we allow integer-valued quadratic forms, and the critical numbers are enlarged to a set of 29 numbers, up to 290.
The 290-Theorem appears to be similar to the 15-Theorem, and the proof has the same structure. However, the weakened condition of being integer-valued vastly increases the number of cases that must be considered. Because of this, the 290-Theorem requires several analytic results on modular forms for the proof.
There is a similar classification of universal four-dimensional integer-valued quadratic forms.

Several generalizations of the 15-Theorem and the 290-Theorem exist: to quadratic forms representing odd numbers, prime numbers, numbers coprime to a certain number, etc.
